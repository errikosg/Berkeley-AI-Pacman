## Project 1 - search


Link: [Pac-man Project 1](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)



**Files that needed to edited:**
	* search.py
	* searchAgents.py

In search.py reside all the algorithms used for the heuristic functions and the problems, while in searchAgents.py reside the actual fuctions (such as cornersProblem, FoodHeuristic etc.)
The files edited are well documented.
